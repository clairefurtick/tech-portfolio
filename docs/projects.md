## Research

I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant for Professor Vora, who does research on Post-Election Tabulation Audits. Here is one of her most recent [papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02315v4.pdf). You can also view the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/gwexploratoryaudits).

I was given my own individual problem to tackle, which was how to consider irrelevant ballots in a sample in order to caluclate more accurate round size estimates for a certain stopping probability. I had to come up with a solution, write software to implement the solution, and then write tests using real election data to confirm that my solution was correct. The research team included the supervising professor, other undergraduates, and other audit and election experts. We met multiple times a week to update each other on our progress, present our work, and discuss important decisions. We also had a weekly reading group that met once a week to discuss weekly readings that consisted of topics such as digital geometry and game theory.

One thing that I loved most about this experience was that the work that I was doing felt meaningful and impactful. The research team also collaborates with voting rights organizations to encourage the use of audits across the country to ensure that we have safe elections!
