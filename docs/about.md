My name is Claire and I am a junior Computer Science major and Mathematics minor at George Washington University! My interests in the Computer Science field are endless and I haven't yet gotten the opportunity to explore all of them and determine if they are something I would want to pursue seriously. These interests range from artificial intelligence and machine learning, to embedded systems and robotics, as well as data analysis and informatics, and much much more. Something I am passionate about is discovering a way to use my love for computer science to create a meaningful and positive impact in my community, or as I like to call it, social justice coding. Outside of my studies, I enjoy cooking and being outdoors!
