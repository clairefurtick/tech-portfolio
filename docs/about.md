My name is Claire and I am a junior Computer Science major, Mathematics minor, and Honors student at George Washington University! My interests in the Computer Science field are endless and I haven't yet gotten the opportunity to explore all of them and determine if they are something I would want to pursue seriously. These interests range from embedded systems and robotics to artificial intelligence and machine learning, and much much more. Some of my favorite computer science courses so far have been Systems Engineering, Databases, and Operating Systems. Something I am passionate about is discovering a way to use my love for computer science to create meaningful technologies that have a positive impact on my community, or as I like to call it, social justice coding. Outside of my studies, I enjoy cooking and being outdoors!
